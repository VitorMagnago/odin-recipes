# Basic HTML project for The Odin Project Foundations Course

### <p align="center">Select language [Portugu√™s](./README.md) 

This project is the proposal presented in the ["Foundations Course" of the website The Odin Project][def]. In this activity we must create a website with the basic knowledge of HTML acquired in the course. 

We must create a recipe web site, consisting of an index page with 3 links to recipe pages. The idea of the project was to copy some food recipes to use in the project, but I preferred another type of recipe. The 3 recipes I chose are related to one of my favorite hobbies, craft beer production, and 3 of my favorite beer styles.  üçª

Despite not having prior knowledge, the activity is quite simple, but I practiced to the fullest, mainly in the use of Git commands. The large amount of commits for such a simple project was deliberate, to learn the Git workflow of "adds", "commits" and "push" and also to fix the concepts of [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) and [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/pt-br/v1.0.0/).

Cheers!
