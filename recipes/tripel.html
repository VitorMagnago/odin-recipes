    <h1>Belgian Tripel </h1>

    <p><em>Brew like a monk!</em></p>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        The Trappist monks of Westmalle Abbey have produced the Tripel as their premier beer style for over 70 years. This pale, strong beer of is recognized by its fruit and spice aromas and sweet malt flavor that seems to quickly dissipate from the tongue. The simplicity of the base recipe makes this an excellent style for the beginning homebrewer, but it will also push the limits for the advanced homebrewer trying to capture that perfect Belgian yeast character.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>9 pounds Pilsner malt extract</li>
        <li>1 pound light Belgian candy sugar</li>
        <li>1 pound Carapils malt, crushed</li>
        <li>2 ounces Hallertau hops - 60 minutes</li>
        <li>6 gallons of tap water, split</li>
        <li>2 Liter starter of liquid Belgian Ale yeast (Whitelabs WLP500 or Wyeast 1214)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>If possible, place 3 gallons in the refrigerator to cool in a sanitized container.</li>
        <li>Tie the Carapils malt in a large mesh grain bag or hop bag. Place the bag in 3 gallons of water in a 5 gallon pot and immerse the grain.</li>
        <li>Begin to heat, making sure mesh bag isn’t sitting directly on the bottom of the pot. Remove the grain bag when the temperature reaches 170°.</li>
        <li>Bring wort to a vigorous boil. As water is heating, slowly add 2 pounds of Pilsner liquid malt extract, stirring constantly until completely dissolved. When the boil begins, add 2 ounces Hallertau hops in a mesh bag.</li>
        <li>After 45 minutes of boiling has passed, add remaining 7 pounds of Pilsner liquid malt extract and 1 pound of Belgian candy sugar, stirring constantly until completely dissolved.</li>
        <li>After total of 60 minutes of boil, remove from heat. Warning: After wort cools below 180°F everything that touches it should be sanitary, and exposure to open air should be limited as much as possible.</li>
        <li>Cool wort by placing pot in ice bath until it is below 85°F. Transfer to sanitized fermentor (either a carboy or a fermentation bucket). Top off to make 5 gallons using refrigerated water.</li>
        <li>Use a sanitized auto-siphon racking cane to remove enough wort to take a gravity reading with your hydrometer. Make a note of this number, since you will be using it to calculate the actual alcohol content when it's done fermenting. The reading should be around 1.075.</li>
        <li>Carefully pour yeast into cooled wort (it should be below 70°F), and agitate vigorously. Cover fermentor with a sanitized stopper and airlock. Ferment in dark place, keeping ambient temperature consistent, preferably between 68 and 70°F.</li>
        <li>After primary fermentation is complete (take at least two consistent gravity readings), transfer to a secondary carboy for conditioning as discussed here and store as cool as possible.</li>
        <li>Bottle after another four to six weeks using enough priming sugar for a high level of carbonation according to these instructions.</li>
    </ol>
