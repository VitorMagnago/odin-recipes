    <h1>S.M.a.S.H IPA</h1>

    <p><em>Why do frogs like IPAs so much? Cause of all the hops </em></p>
    
    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        A group of dedicated home brewers have coined the term “SMaSH” to help drive simpler brewing. SMaSH stands for “Single Malt and Single Hops”. The idea is to break brewing down to its basic elements and emphasize the flavor of a single malt and single hop variety.

    <p>
        For this SMaSH (Single Malt and Single Hop) beer, I chose Mosaic hops, the daughter of American IPA hop stalwart Simcoe.  To round things out, I paired the Mosaic hops with the sweet, clean Golden Promise pale malt.
