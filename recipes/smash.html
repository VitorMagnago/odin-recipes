        <p><em>Why do frogs like IPAs so much? Cause of all the hops. </em></p>

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            A group of dedicated home brewers have coined the term “SMaSH” to help drive simpler brewing. SMaSH stands for “Single Malt and Single Hops”. The idea is to break brewing down to its basic elements and emphasize the flavor of a single malt and single hop variety. 
        </p>

        <p>
            For this SMaSH (Single Malt and Single Hop) beer, I chose Mosaic hops, the daughter of American IPA hop stalwart Simcoe.  To round things out, I paired the Mosaic hops with the sweet, clean Golden Promise pale malt.

        <h2>Ingredientes</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>12 pounds Golden Promise malt</li>
            <li>1 ounce Mosaic hops, 12.3% AA (first wort hop)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 ounces Mosaic hops, 12.3% AA (15 minutes)</li>
            <li>1 tablet Whirlfloc (15 minutes)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon Wyeast yeast nutrient blend (10 minutes)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 ounces Mosaic hops, 12.3% AA (0 minutes)</li>
            <li>Wyeast 1056 American Ale yeast</li>
            <li>2 ounces Mosaic hops, 12.3% AA (dry hop; 5-6 days in secondary)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 15 quarts tap water to 164°F and add to mash tun.</li>
            <li>Mash-in slowly, adding all grains to the mash tun while stirring to prevent clumping. The mash temperature should equalize to 152°F.</li>
            <li>In a separate container, heat 8.4 quarts tap water to 202°F.</li>
            <li>Mash out by adding 8.4 quarts of 202°F tap water to mash tun, while stirring, after allowing the mash to rest for 60 minutes. Temperature should equalize to approximately 168°F.</li>
            <li>Leave at mash out temperature for 15 minutes. In a separate container, heat 2.8 gallons tap water to 172°F.</li>
            <li>Slowly drain off wort and add back to mash tun, recirculating until the wort runs clear and free of grain particles.</li>
            <li>Drain mash tun to boil kettle, sparging with 2.8 gallons of 172°F tap water. Add first wort hops once the kettle is full.</li>
            <li>After all mash runnings are collected, record preboil gravity. Bring wort to boil.</li>
            <li>Allow wort to boil 60 minutes, adding hops, Whirlfloc and yeast nutrients as noted above.</li>
            <li>Chill wort and transfer to a sanitized carboy or bucket with an airlock. Aerate by shaking or oxygenate with an oxygenation stone.</li>
            <li>Pitch yeast and allow to ferment at 66°F to 68°F.</li>
            <li>Once the gravity is within a few points of your target final gravity (about 1.014), rack beer to second sanitized carboy or bucket with dry hops in a sanitized hop sack and allow to condition for 5 to 6 days.</li>
            <li>Bottle or keg at 2.6 volumes.</li>
        </ol>
